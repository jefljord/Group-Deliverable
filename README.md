SBI Management System
Jeffrey Jordan and Kevin Patel

SBI, which stands for Stone Brook Inn, Management system is a user-friendly program that allows local hotel owners to transition from pen 
and paper to a modern, clean, efficient graphical interface system that will handle the entirety of the check-in proces.

In it's current developmental state, the check in features are locked. Still, users can see what the basic structure of the program will
look like as the skeleton has been implemented.
